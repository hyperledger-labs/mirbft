# MirBFT Library

This open-source project is part of [Hyperledger Labs](https://labs.hyperledger.org/labs/mir-bft.html).
It aims at developing a production-quality implementation of the
[Mir Byzantine fault tolerant consensus protocol](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05552)
and integrating it with Hyperledger Fabric.
Being framed as a library, however, MirBFT's goal is also to serve as a general-purpose high-performance BFT component
of other projects as well.

The [research branch](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/mirbft/tree/research) contains code developed independently
as a research prototype and was used to produce experimental results
for the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05552).

## Current status

This library is in development and not usable yet.
This document describes what the library _should become_ rather than what it _currently is_.
This document itself is more than likely to still change.
You are more than welcome to contribute to accelerating the development of the MirBFT library.
Have a look at the [Contributions section](#contributing) if you want to help out!

## Overview

MirBFT is a library implementing the [Mir byzantine fault tolerant consensus protocol](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05552)
in a network transport, storage, and cryptographic algorithm agnostic way.
MirBFT hopes to be a building block of a next generation of distributed systems,
providing an implementation of [atomic broadcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_broadcast)
which can be utilized by any distributed system.

MirBFT improves on traditional atomic broadcast protocols
like [PBFT](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/p398-castro-bft-tocs.pdf) and Raft
which always have a single active leader by allowing concurrent leaders
and reconciling total order in a deterministic way.

The multi-leader nature of Mir should lead to exceptional performance
especially on wide area networks,
but should be suitable for LAN deployments as well.

MirBFT, decouples request payload dissemination from ordering,
outputting totally ordered request digests rather than all request data.
This allows for novel methods of request dissemination.
The provided request dissemination method, however, does guarantee the availability of all request payload data.

## Compiling and running tests

The MirBFT library relies on Protocol Buffers.
The `protoc` compiler and the corresponding Go plugin need to be installed.
Moreover, some dependencies require `gcc` to be installed as well.
On Ubuntu Linux, those can be installed using

```shell
sudo snap install --classic go
sudo snap install --classic protobuf
sudo apt install gcc
```

Once instaled, the Protocol Buffer files need to be generated by executing

```shell
go generate ./protos
```

in the `mirbft` root repository directory.
This command also has to be executed each time the `.proto` files in the `protos` folder change.

Now the tests can be run by executing

```shell
go test
```

The dependencies should be downloaded and installed automatically.
