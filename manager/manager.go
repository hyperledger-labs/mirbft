// A Manager orchestrates the interaction between the different modules (Log, Orderer, Checkpointer, ...).
// The main task of the Manager is to split the log up into Segments that can be ordered independently and in parallel.
// A Segment groups a subset of (not necessarily contiguous) sequence numbers of the log and lists the nodes that
// are responsible for agreeing on an order of Entries for these sequence numbers. (See the segment.go file itself.)
// The Manager informs the corresponding nodes about Segments they are involved in.
// The Manager also triggers the checkpointing protocol when appropriate.
// The decisions of the Manager about when to issue a new Segment or when to trigger the checkpointing protocol are
// mainly based on observing the state of the log.

	// to be started.

	// to be started.
	SubscribeCheckpointer() chan int32

	// Starts the Manager, making it start issuing Segments and sequence numbers for checkpointing.
	// The Orderer and the Checkpointer need to have subscribed by the time Start() is called.

	// (e.g. subscribing to log events such as Entries or Checkpoints), as these actions may be delayed arbitrarily.
	// Decrements the provided wait group when done.

//      instead of allocating new copies on each call. However, as this function is not called very often,
