// The Orderer is responsible for ordering log Entries, i.e., creating the mapping between Entries and sequence numbers.
// It receives Segments (representing parts of the log) from the Manager and "fills" these parts of the log with
// Entries. The Orderer can process multiple Segments in parallel, executing multiple instances of an ordering protocol
// (or even different protocols) - one for each Segment.
// When a (final and irreversible) assignment of an Entry to a sequence number is made by the ordering protocol,
// the protocol calls announcer.Announce() to announce the decision.

	// Attaches a Manager to the Orderer. All the Segments that are created by the Manager and in which this node is
	// involved (as a leader, as a follower, or both) will be handled by this Orderer.
	// Init() must be called before the Manager is started, so the Orderer does not miss any segments.
	// Init() must be called before Strat() is called.
	// After Init() returns, the Orderer mus be ready to process incoming messages, but must not send any itself
	// (sending messages only can start after the call to Start()).
